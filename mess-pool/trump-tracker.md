He made a lot of promises. Trump Tracker intends to fact-check and see if he adheres to all of his stands on policies regarding culture, immigration, economy, and many more.

The website gives us access to a list of Trump's promises. These promises can take five different states, not started, in progress, achieved, broken and compromised.
